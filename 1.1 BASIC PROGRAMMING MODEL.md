Our study of algorithms is based upon implementing them as programs written in the Java programming language. We do so for several reasons:

- Our programs are `concise adj. 简明的，简洁的`, `elegant adj. 优雅的，精美的，雅致的`, and complete descriptions of algorithms.
- You can run the programs to study `properties n. 财产；性质，性能` of the algorithms.
- You can put the algorithms immediately to good use in applications.

These are important and significant advantages over the alternatives of working with English-language descriptions of algorithms.

A potential `downside n. 缺点，不利方面` to this approach is that we have to work with a specific programming language, possibly making it difficult to ***separate*** the idea of the algorithm ***from*** the details of its implementation. Our implementations are designed to `mitigate v. <正式>减轻，缓和` this difficulty, by using programming `constructs n. 构想，观念；建筑物，创造物；结构体` that are both found in many modern languages and needed to `adequately adv. 充分地，足够地；适当地` describe the algorithms.

We use only a small `subset n. [数] 子集` of Java. While we stop short of formally defining the subset that we use, you will see that we make use of ~~relatively~~ few Java constructs, and that we emphasize those that are found in many modern programming languages. The code that we present is complete, and our expectation is that you will download it and execute it, on our test data or test data of your own choosing.

We `refer to 提及，谈到` the programming constructs, software libraries, and operating system features that we use to implement and describe algorithms as our programming model.In this section and Section 1.2, we fully describe this programming model. The treatment is `self-contained adj. 独立的` and primarily ***intended for 旨在*** documentation and ***for*** your reference in understanding any code in the book. The model we describe is the same model introduced in our book An Introduction to Programming in Java: An Interdisciplinary Approach, which provides a `slower-paced 慢节奏的` introduction to the `material 材料，这里指书的内容?`.

For reference, the `figure （书中的）图、表` on the facing page `depicts v. 描述，描绘` a complete Java program that illustrates many of the basic features of our programming model. We use this code for examples when discussing language features, but `defer v. 延期，推迟；听从` considering it in detail to page 46 (it implements a classic algorithm known as binary search and tests it for an application known as whitelist filtering). We assume that you have experience programming in some modern language, so that you are likely to recognize many of these features in this code. Page references are included in the `annotations 注释` to help you find answers to any questions that you might have. Since our code is somewhat stylized and we `strive to 尽力做某事` make consistent use of various Java `idioms 风格，特色` and constructs, it is worthwhile even for experienced Java programmers to read the information in this section.

**Basic structure of a Java program**
A Java program ( class) is ***either*** a library of static methods (functions) ***or*** a data type definition. To create libraries of static methods and data-type definitions, we use the following five components, the basis of programming in Java and many other modern languages:

- **Primitive data types** ~~precisely~~ define the meaning of `terms 术语 ` like integer, real number, and boolean value within a computer program. Their definition includes the set of possible values and operations on those values, which can be combined into expressions like mathematical expressions that define values.

- **Statements** allow us to define a computation by creating and ***assigning*** values ***to*** variables, controlling execution flow, or causing `side effects 副作用`. We use six types of statements: declarations, `assignments 赋值`, conditionals, loops, calls, and returns.

- **Arrays** allow us to work with multiple values of the same type.

- **Static methods** allow us to `encapsulate vt. 封装` and reuse code and to develop programs as a set of independent modules.

- **Strings** are sequences of characters. Some operations on them are built in to Java.
  
- **Input/output** `sets up 建立，创立` communication between programs and the outside world.

- **Data abstraction** extends encapsulation and reuse to allow us to define non-primitive data types, thus supporting `object-oriented 面向对象` programming.

In this section, we will consider the first five of these `in turn 依次，轮流`. Data abstraction is the topic of the next section.

Running a Java program involves interacting with an operating system or a program development environment. ~~For clarity and economy,~~ we describe such actions `in terms of 用……来表示,就……而言` a virtual terminal, where we interact with programs by typing commands to the system. See the booksite for details on using a `virtual 虚拟的，模拟的` terminal on your system, or for information on using one of the many more advanced program development environments that are available on modern systems.

For example, BinarySearch is two static methods, rank() and main(). The first static method, rank(), is four statements: two declarations, a loop (which is itself an assignment and two conditionals), and a return. The second, main(), is three statements:a declaration, a call, and a loop (which is itself an assignment and a conditional).

To invoke a Java program, we first compile it using the javac command, then run it using the java command. For example, to run BinarySearch, we first type the command javac BinarySearch.java (which creates a file BinarySearch.class that contains a lower-level version of the program in Java bytecode in the file BinarySearch.class).Then we type java BinarySearch (followed by a whitelist file name) to ***transfer*** control ***to*** the bytecode version of the program. To develop a basis for understanding the effect of these actions, we next consider in detail primitive data types and expressions, the various kinds of Java statements, arrays, static methods, strings, and input/output.

`Primitive adj. 原始的，远古的` data types and expressions
A data type is a set of values and a set of operations on those values. We begin by considering the following four primitive data
types that are the basis of the Java language:
- **Integers**, with `arithmetic adj. 算术的 n. 算术` operations (int)
- **Real numbers 实数**, again with arithmetic operations (double)
- **Booleans**, the set of values { true, false } with logical operations (boolean)
- **Characters**, the `alphanumeric [ˌælfənuːˈmerɪk] 字母数字的` characters and symbols that you type (char) 

Next we consider mechanisms for specifying values and operations for these types.

A Java program `manipulates 操作` variables that are named with `identifier 标识符`. Each variable is ***associated with*** a data type and stores one of the permissible data-type values. In Java code, we use expressions like familiar mathematical expressions to apply the operations associated with each type. For primitive types, we use identifiers to refer to variables, operator symbols such as + - * / to specify operations, `literals 文字` such as 1 or 3.14 to specify values, and expressions such as (x + 2.236)/2 to specify operations on values. The purpose of an expression is to define one of the data-type values.

|term|examples|definition|
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|primitive data type | int double boolean char| a set of values and a set of operations on those values (built in to the Java language) |
|`identifier 标识符`|a abc Ab$ a_b ab123 lo hi|a sequence of `letters 字母`, digits,_, and $, the first of which is not a digit|
|variable|[any identifier]|names a data-type value|
|operator|+ - * /|names a data-type operation|
|literal|<br>int 1 0 -42 </br> <br>double 2.0 1.0e-15 3.14 </br> <br>boolean true false </br> <br>char 'a' '+' '9' '\n'</br>|source-code representation of a value|
|expression|<br>int lo + (hi - lo)/2</br> <br></br>double 1.0e-15 * t <br>boolean lo <= hi</br>|a literal, a variable, or a sequence of operations on literals and/or variables that produces a value|

To define a data type, we need only specify the values and the set of operations on those values. This information is summarized in the table below for Java’s int, double, boolean, and char data types. These data types are similar to the basic data types found in many programming languages. For int and double, the operations are familiar arithmetic operations; for boolean, they are familiar logical operations. It is important to note that +, -, *, and / are overloaded—the same `symbol 符号` specifies operations in multiple different types, depending on context. The key property of these primitive operations is that an operation involving values of a given type has a value of that type. This rule highlights the idea that we are often working with `approximate values 近似值`, since it is often the case that the exact value that would seem to be defined by the expression is not a value of the type. For example, 5/3 has the value 1 and 5.0/3.0 has a value very close to 1.66666666666667 but neither of these is exactly equal to 5/3. This table is far from complete; we discuss some additional operators and various exceptional situations that we occasionally need to consider in the Q&A at the end of this section.

***Expressions***. As illustrated in the table at the bottom of the previous page, typical expressions are `infix n. 中缀`: a literal (or an expression), followed by an operator, followed by another literal (or another expression). When an expression contains more than one operator, the order in which they are applied is often significant, so the following precedence `conventions n.惯例；大会，集会；公约，协定` are part of the Java language specification: The operators * and / ( and %) have higher precedence than (are applied before) the + and - operators; among logical operators, ! is the highest precedence, followed by && and then ||. Generally, operators of the same precedence are applied left to right. As in standard arithmetic expressions, you can use `parentheses n. 圆括号` to override these rules. Since precedence rules vary slightly from language to language, we use parentheses and otherwise `strive to 努力` avoid dependence on precedence rules in our code. 

***Type conversion 类型转换***. Numbers are automatically ***promoted to 晋升*** a more inclusive type if no information is lost. For example, in the expression 1 + 2.5 , the 1 is promoted to the double value 1.0 and the expression evaluates to the double value 3.5 . A cast is a type name in parentheses within an expression, a directive to convert the following value into a value of that type. For example (int) 3.7 is 3 and (double) 3 is 3.0. Note that casting to an int is `truncation 截断` instead of `rounding—rules 舍入规则` for casting within complicated expressions can be `intricate adj. 错综复杂的；难理解的`, and casts should be used sparingly and with care. A best practice is to use expressions that involve literals or variables of a single type. 

***Comparisons***. The following operators compare two values of the same type and produce a boolean value: equal (==), not equal (!=), less than (<), less than or equal (<=), greater than (>), and greater than or equal (>=). These operators are known as mixed-type operators because their value is boolean, not the type of the values being compared. An expression with a boolean value is known as a boolean expression. Such expressions are essential components in conditional and loop statements, as we will see.

***Other primitive types***. Java’s int has $2^{32}$ different values by design, so it can be represented in a 32-bit machine word (many machines have 64-bit words nowadays, but the 32-bit int persists). Similarly, the double standard specifies a 64-bit representation. These data-type sizes are adequate for typical applications that use integers and real numbers. To provide flexibility, Java has five additional primitive data types: 

- 64-bit integers, with arithmetic operations ( long) 
- 16-bit integers, with arithmetic operations ( short) 
- 16-bit characters, with arithmetic operations (char) 
- 8-bit integers, with arithmetic operations ( byte) 
- 32-bit single-precision real numbers, again with arithmetic operations ( float) 

We most often use int and double arithmetic operations in this book, so we do not consider the others (which are very similar) in further detail here.
