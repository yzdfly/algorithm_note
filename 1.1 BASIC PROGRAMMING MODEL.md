Our study of algorithms is based upon implementing them as programs written in the Java programming language. We do so for several reasons:

- Our programs are `concise adj. 简明的，简洁的`, `elegant adj. 优雅的，精美的，雅致的`, and complete descriptions of algorithms.
- You can run the programs to study `properties n. 财产；性质，性能` of the algorithms.
- You can put the algorithms immediately to good use in applications.

These are important and significant advantages over the alternatives of working with English-language descriptions of algorithms.

A potential `downside n. 缺点，不利方面` to this approach is that we have to work with a specific programming language, possibly making it difficult to ***separate*** the idea of the algorithm ***from*** the details of its implementation. Our implementations are designed to `mitigate v. <正式>减轻，缓和` this difficulty, by using programming `constructs n. 构想，观念；建筑物，创造物；结构体` that are both found in many modern languages and needed to `adequately adv. 充分地，足够地；适当地` describe the algorithms.

We use only a small `subset n. [数] 子集` of Java. While we stop short of formally defining the subset that we use, you will see that we make use of ~~relatively~~ few Java constructs, and that we emphasize those that are found in many modern programming languages. The code that we present is complete, and our expectation is that you will download it and execute it, on our test data or test data of your own choosing.

We `refer to 提及，谈到` the programming constructs, software libraries, and operating system features that we use to implement and describe algorithms as our programming model.In this section and Section 1.2, we fully describe this programming model. The treatment is `self-contained adj. 独立的` and primarily ***intended for 旨在*** documentation and ***for*** your reference in understanding any code in the book. The model we describe is the same model introduced in our book An Introduction to Programming in Java: An Interdisciplinary Approach, which provides a `slower-paced 慢节奏的` introduction to the `material 材料，这里指书的内容?`.

For reference, the `figure （书中的）图、表` on the facing page `depicts v. 描述，描绘` a complete Java program that illustrates many of the basic features of our programming model. We use this code for examples when discussing language features, but `defer v. 延期，推迟；听从` considering it in detail to page 46 (it implements a classic algorithm known as binary search and tests it for an application known as whitelist filtering). We assume that you have experience programming in some modern language, so that you are likely to recognize many of these features in this code. Page references are included in the `annotations 注释` to help you find answers to any questions that you might have. Since our code is somewhat stylized and we `strive to 尽力做某事` make consistent use of various Java `idioms 风格，特色` and constructs, it is worthwhile even for experienced Java programmers to read the information in this section.

**Basic structure of a Java program**
A Java program ( class) is ***either*** a library of static methods (functions) ***or*** a data type definition. To create libraries of static methods and data-type definitions, we use the following five components, the basis of programming in Java and many other modern languages:

- **Primitive data types** ~~precisely~~ define the meaning of `terms 术语 ` like integer, real number, and boolean value within a computer program. Their definition includes the set of possible values and operations on those values, which can be combined into expressions like mathematical expressions that define values.

- **Statements** allow us to define a computation by creating and ***assigning*** values ***to*** variables, controlling execution flow, or causing `side effects 副作用`. We use six types of statements: declarations, `assignments 赋值`, conditionals, loops, calls, and returns.

- **Arrays** allow us to work with multiple values of the same type.

- **Static methods** allow us to `encapsulate vt. 封装` and reuse code and to develop programs as a set of independent modules.

- **Strings** are sequences of characters. Some operations on them are built in to Java.
  
- **Input/output** `sets up 建立，创立` communication between programs and the outside world.

- **Data abstraction** extends encapsulation and reuse to allow us to define non-primitive data types, thus supporting `object-oriented 面向对象` programming.

In this section, we will consider the first five of these `in turn 依次，轮流`. Data abstraction is the topic of the next section.

Running a Java program involves interacting with an operating system or a program development environment. For clarity and economy, we describe such actions `in terms of 用……来表示,就……而言` a virtual terminal, where we interact with programs by typing commands to the system. See the booksite for details on using a virtual `terminal 虚拟的，模拟的` on your system, or for information on using one of the many more advanced program development environments that are available on modern systems.

For example, BinarySearch is two static methods, rank() and main(). The first static method, rank(), is four statements: two declarations, a loop (which is itself an assignment and two conditionals), and a return. The second, main(), is three statements:a declaration, a call, and a loop (which is itself an assignment and a conditional).

To invoke a Java program, we first compile it using the javac command, then run it using the java command. For example, to run BinarySearch, we first type the command javac BinarySearch.java (which creates a file BinarySearch.class that contains a lower-level version of the program in Java bytecode in the file BinarySearch.class).Then we type java BinarySearch (followed by a whitelist file name) to ***transfer*** control ***to*** the bytecode version of the program. To develop a basis for understanding the effect of these actions, we next consider in detail primitive data types and expressions, the various kinds of Java statements, arrays, static methods, strings, and input/output.
